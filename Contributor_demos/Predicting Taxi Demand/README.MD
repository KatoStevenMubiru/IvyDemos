# Taxi Demand Prediction Model

This Jupyter notebook outlines the process of building a predictive model for forecasting taxi demand in a city. The model integrates historical taxi usage data with event data to assist taxi companies in optimizing fleet management and enhancing customer service by anticipating demand fluctuations.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict taxi demand based on historical data, weather conditions, and city events.

## Data Sources

- **Taxi Trips Data**: Historical data of taxi trips, including timestamps, trip details, pickup and dropoff locations, fares, and more.
- **Events Data**: Information about event permits requested through the Chicago Park District, including event names, descriptions, start and end times, locations, and estimated number of attendees.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Load the taxi trips data and events data from the provided API endpoints.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and convert timestamps to appropriate datetime formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the taxi trips data to understand demand patterns and identify peak times.
4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract time-based features from the taxi trips data.
   - Integrate events data by creating a feature indicating the proximity of taxi trips to event locations.
5. **Model Development**:
   - Prepare the dataset for modeling by splitting into features and target, and then into training and testing sets.
   - Use Ivy to develop a predictive model that is framework-agnostic.
6. **Model Training**: Train the model on the training set using Ivy.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics.
8. **Iteration and Optimization**: Refine the model based on performance metrics and iterate on feature engineering and model selection.

## Results

- The model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.
- Insights from the model's predictions are discussed, along with potential areas for improvement.

## Next Steps

- Further optimize the model by experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters.
- Explore additional features that could improve the model's predictive power, such as weather conditions and other external factors.
- Deploy the model to a production environment for real-time demand forecasting.
